# GoPokemon

A SPA to browse pokemons with a similar interface of the game [Pokemon Go](https://pokemongolive.com/en/) made with **Angular 8** and **Ngrx**. ðŸ˜Ž

I'm using the free API [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to get all the pokemon data.

To make the application start need

* NodeJS 10v.
* npm.

Run this command in your console in the root directory.

```
npm install
```

Wait until npm install all the packages and now enter.

```
ng serve
```

Once it finish go to [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/) and you will see the app running ðŸ‘Œ
